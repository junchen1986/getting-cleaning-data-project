Repo for the submission of the course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data @ coursera.

Use run_analysis.R to automate the process described in the project summary, which is also pasted below:

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Use CODEBOOD.MD for explanation of the output file column and the R code.
